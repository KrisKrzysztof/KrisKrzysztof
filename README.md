- 👋 Hi, I’m @KrisKrzysztof aka Krzysztof Iwański.
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering this world... so travels, technologies, events (as music and other entertainments, as all exeptional events on the world), psychology, sport.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Javascript and TypeScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project when can I use my abilities, get experience and of course earn first money from programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: facebook messenger https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztofams
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr.
- ⚡ I moved to the Netherlands to earn some money and move back to bigger city in Poland... but I loved Amsterdam and decided to stay there ;)
